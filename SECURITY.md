## Reporting a Vulnerability

# Security Policy for Cronk

Cronk is an in-development educational project designed to demonstrate both common security pitfalls and best practices in supply-chain security. We welcome responsible reports of vulnerabilities to help improve the overall security of the project.

## Scope

This policy applies to the [Cronk repository](https://github.com/O-Carneiro/cronk-o-carneiro) and any associated components, tools, or documentation provided by the maintainers. It covers security issues related to the project’s code, configuration, and deployment.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability or potential issue, please follow these guidelines:

- **Do Not Publicly Disclose:** To protect all users, do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until they have been resolved.
- **Report Privately:** Email your report to our dedicated security team at:  
  **ocarneiro1@gmail.com**  
- **Include Detailed Information:** When reporting, please provide a detailed description, including:
  - Steps to reproduce the issue
  - Potential impact or risks associated with the vulnerability
  - Any relevant logs, screenshots, or code snippets (ensure sensitive information is redacted)
- **Use the Appropriate Subject Line:** Use a subject like “Security Vulnerability Report – [Short Description]” to help us prioritize and route your report efficiently.

## Disclosure and Remediation Process

- **Acknowledgment:** We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days.
- **Investigation:** Our team will investigate the issue and communicate with you to clarify details if needed.
- **Resolution Timeline:** We strive to address confirmed vulnerabilities as quickly as possible. In general, we aim for a resolution within 90 days. If additional time is needed, we will keep you informed.
- **Public Disclosure:** Once the vulnerability has been fixed, we will publish a summary of the issue along with a security advisory, ensuring you receive appropriate credit for your contribution if you wish.
- **No Legal Action:** In accordance with responsible disclosure practices, we will not initiate legal action against researchers who report issues in good faith.

## Additional Security Considerations

- **Use of Secure Channels:** All communications regarding security issues should be conducted over secure channels (e.g., encrypted email).
- **Testing Environment:** Please refrain from testing in production environments. Use a controlled environment to validate vulnerabilities.
- **Educational Disclaimer:** As an educational project, Cronk’s code intentionally includes examples of insecure practices for learning purposes. However, any security issue that poses a genuine risk to users or infrastructure will be taken seriously and addressed promptly.
